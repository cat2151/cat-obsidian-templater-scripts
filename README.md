# Obsidian Templater Scripts
- User scripts for Obsidian Templater Plugin.
## Who is this for?
- Those who have some experience with the Templater community plugin and are looking for more basic and concrete API examples.
- For example, "I hear the Templater community plugin allows writing JavaScript in templates.
  - This means I can call Obsidian's API and do a lot.
  - But I couldn't get it to work. I'm not sure why."
## What is it for?
- Sharing useful features
    - You will be able to use the `sakuraeditor_bookmark_like` and `insert_file` features described below.
- Sharing know-how
    - The Templater plugin is convenient because it allows you to call Obsidian's API with JavaScript.
    - You can do things similar to text editor macros.
        - For example, like HideMaru Editor, text editor "Mery", or Sakura Editor.
        - It's suitable when you want to quickly add functionality to Obsidian compared to community plugins.
    - After trying it, I felt it would be easier if there were materials that could quickly demonstrate something like `Hello, World!`.
    - Therefore, I am publishing `templater_js_hot` and `insert_file` below. I hope they will be of some reference.
## What can it do?
- `sakuraeditor_bookmark_like`
    - What does it do?:
        - Highlights the current line. It toggles the highlight.
        - If text is selected, it behaves the same as Obsidian's built-in "Toggle highlight" feature.
    - Examples from other editors:
        - Sakura Editor's "Set/Clear Bookmark" (`CTRL + F2`)
        - HideMaru Editor's "Mark Current Line"
- `sakuraeditor_abookmark_next`
    - Sakura Editor's "Next Bookmark" (`F2`)
- `sakuraeditor_abookmark_prev`
    - Sakura Editor's "Previous Bookmark" (`SHIFT + F2`)
- `insert_file`
    - What does it do?:
        - Inserts the specified file at the current line (deletes the current line).
    - What is it for?:
        - For example, you can integrate it into your daily note template.
            - For instance, you prepare a line like `Insert 8 PM tasks here`, and at 8 PM, you click it. The line `Insert 8 PM tasks here` is deleted, and the prepared Templates file is inserted there. You can also use it to write `Insert 9 PM tasks here` at the end of that file.
        - This is just one example. It's assumed that there are more suitable uses depending on the user.
- `templater_js_hot`
    - This is a snippet-like feature.
        - It's a collection of small, self-contained code snippets, like `Hello, World!`.
        - They are commented out.
        - Uncommenting each one will make it functional.
    - I use it assigned to `CTRL + T`.
        - Both `sakuraeditor_bookmark_like` and `insert_file` were developed using this.
    - The advantage is low adoption and maintenance costs due to its small scale.
        - The disadvantage is fewer development support features (compared to other large-scale development environments).
        - It's intended for initial adoption and writing small-scale scripts.
## How to use it?
- `sakuraeditor_bookmark_like`
    - Templater
        - Install the Templater community plugin in Obsidian.
    - Folder
        - Set the "Script files folder location" in Templater settings under "User Script Functions".
            - For example, `TemplaterJS`
    - File Placement
        - In the `Templates` and `TemplaterJS` directories located under your vault,
            - copy the contents of this repository's `Templates` and `TemplaterJS` directories.
            - (These are Markdown and JavaScript files)
    - Hotkey
        - In the "Template Hotkeys" section of Templater settings, enter, for example, `Templates/sakuraeditor_bookmark_like.md`.
        - Click the nearby "+" button, open the hotkey settings, enter `sakura` in the top-right field, confirm that "Templater: Insert Templates/sakuraeditor_bookmark_like.md" is displayed,
        - click the "+" button on the right,
        - and assign a key, for example, by pressing `CTRL + F2`.
    - Verify Operation
        - Press `CTRL + F2` and confirm that the current line is highlighted.
        - Press it again and confirm that the current line's highlight disappears (toggles off).
- `sakuraeditor_abookmark_next`
    - For now, I'm holding off on using it.
        - This is because it conflicts with Obsidian's standard `F2` function (rename note).
            - For now, I prioritize renaming notes.
- `sakuraeditor_abookmark_prev`
    - Setup
        - Prerequisite: The steps for `sakuraeditor_bookmark_like` must have been completed.
        - Similarly, assign `sakuraeditor_bookmark_like_prev.md` to `SHIFT + F2`.
    - Verify Operation
        - Press `SHIFT + F2` and confirm that it jumps to the highlighted line.
- `insert_file`
    - Setup
        - Prerequisite: The steps for `sakuraeditor_bookmark_like` must have been completed.
        - Advanced URI
            - Install the [Advanced URI community plugin](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri).
            - Open the Advanced URI options screen and turn off all settings like `Open file on write`. This is to ensure reliable operation verification. I use it with all settings off as is.
        - Register Template command
            - In the "Template Hotkeys" section of Templater settings, register the following two, for example:
                - `Templates/insert_file.md`
                - `Templates/insert_fileを書く用テンプレ.md`
    - Verify Operation
        - Type `insert_file` in the command palette, or `/insert_file` as a slash command.
        - Select `insert Templates/insert_fileを書く用テンプレ.md` from the suggestions.
        - Confirm that `[Insert test md (deletes current line)](obsidian://adv-uri?commandid=templater-obsidian:Templates/insert_file.md&insert-filename=Templates/insert_fileを書く用テンプレ用test.md)` is inserted at the current line.
        - Click it.
        - Confirm that the current line becomes `This is the content of insert_fileを書く用テンプレ用test.md`.
    - Note
        - The [Shukuchi community plugin](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/shukuchi) is convenient for quick keyboard-only use.
        - It can be used as if "quickly pressing a convenient button with the keyboard". I use this method daily.
- `templater_js_hot`
    - Setup
        - Prerequisite: The steps for `sakuraeditor_bookmark_like` must have been completed.
        - Similarly, assign `Templater_js_hot.md` to `CTRL + T`.
    - Edit
        - Edit `Templater_js_hot.js`.
            - Uncomment the `hello, world` line.
    - Verify Operation
        - Press `CTRL + T` and confirm that "Hello, World!" is inserted at the cursor's location.
